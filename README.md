# 🍞 Bread Supply Chain Database 

This open source project aims to build a database for tracking bread supply chain operations including customers, products, orders, fulfillment processes, and **microbiome data** to enhance yeast production and bread quality.

## 🥐 Contents

The database contains tables for:

- Customers 
- Products
- Orders
- Bakeries 
- Deliveries

Additional tables will be added such as:

- Ingredients
- Inventory 
- Production logs
- Microbiome data
- Reviews

## 📈 Usage 

The database uses SQLite but can be ported to PostgreSQL or MySQL. Python scripts handle:

- Schema creation
- Populating sample data 
- Database connectivity
- Analytics & visualizations

## 👩‍🔬 Microbiome Analysis  

A key goal is integrating **microbiome data** like:

- Yeast quality metrics
- Bread starter cultures
- Processing environment conditions

To provide **certification** and **traceability** of bread products.

## 🤝 Open Collaboration

As an open source project, we welcome contributions!
